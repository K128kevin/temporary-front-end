        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            This site is a web application that I (Kevin) have created to publicly display the results of my
            experiments involving artificial intelligence. Specifically, this work focuses on neural networks,
            and even more specifically, it focuses on time series prediction for various commodities. On the
            charts page, you can select a commodity and see a chart of predictions for that commodity for the
            next 24 hours or for the next 5 days. You can also see how that chart performed over the past 24
            hours or 5 days in a chart below, which overlays predicted and actual prices.
        </p>
        <h3>What does the answer to the previous section even mean?</h3>
        <p>
            Simply put, this web site displays predictions created by artificial intellgence algorithms. Currently,
            the predictions being shown are time series predictions for various commodity prices/exchange rates. In
            the future, I may work on providing predictions for other types of data sets.
        </p>
        <h3>How accurate is this?</h3>
        <p>
            It is difficult to provide a meaningful statistic to represent the accuracy of a predictive model like
            this one. What I've found to be the most reasonable means of measuring accuracy is to calculate how far
            off each point in each prediction is from the actual price, on average. This varies from commodity to
            commodity, and you can see the value above the chart. At the time I am writing this, I have not yet done a
            lot of experimenting with assets besides bitcoin, but the average error for the 24 hour bitcoin price
            prediction chart is generally around 0.5%.
        </p>
        <h3>More details about testing and figures of accuracy</h3>
        <p>
            To calculate the average error of a chart, I run the neural network that created this chart on historic
            price data. The process of creating a neural network that can predict future prices involves "training"
            the neural network on historic price data. What I do for testing is that I set aside about 20% of my
            historic data and do not use that for training the neural network. Once the neural network is trained,
            I have it make predictions at every point in the allocated test data. I use these predictions to calculate
            the average error. Just to clarify, the average error represents how far, on average, each predicted
            point on the chart is off from the actual price at that time.
        </p>
        <h3>If this is so accurate, why are you sharing it?</h3>
        <p>
            The figures of accuracy above make this model sound like it is far more amazing than it is. It is important
            to consider two things. One, 0.5% is just an average, and the error can easily be much higher than that
            sometimes. Of course, it can be much lower (or even zero) at other times. Two, a 0.5% error is still a
            reasonably sized error. If the prediction shows the price of bitcoin being at $450 at a given time, a 0.5%
            error means that on average, it will be between $447.75 and $452.25. It is also possible that the price
            could end up being way outside of that range.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, I come to this from a computer science/artificial intelligence background, not a financial one.
            I do not trade assets based on this data (or at all, for that matter). I simply find it to be a fun problem
            to solve. I may try trading one day in the future, but right now I just see this as a complicated but fun
            artificial intelligence/computer science challenge.

        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Kevin and I am a software engineer. I graduated from college in spring of 2014 and I've been
            working in the Boston area ever since. I mostly do web development, but I spend a lot of time on the side
            learning about artificial intelligence and experimenting with time series prediction. I started working on
            this project in the fall of 2013, and I had the very first version of the site up on March 13th, 2014. I
            decided to create this not because of my interest in bitcoin and trading, but rather because I found (and still
            find) artificial neural networks to be amazing. I learned about them during a couple of courses in college and
            I'm constantly amazed by how they can perform complicated tasks often better than humans.
